Welcome to the <tt class="ttfamily">latex2edx</tt> demo course! </p><p>
This course provides examples of some of the capabilities of the latex2edx system, which compiles </p>[mathjax]\LaTeX[/mathjax]<p>
 into XML code for edX courses. </p><p>
The focus of this system is on providing sophisticated auto-gradable science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) problems, by extending a document preparation system to provide interactive &#x201C;answer boxes" for student input and auto-grader responses. </p></html>
