Welcome to the \texttt{latex2edx} demo course!

This course provides examples of some of the capabilities of the
latex2edx system, which compiles \LaTeX\ into XML code for edX courses.

The focus of this system is on providing sophisticated auto-gradable
science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) problems, by
extending a document preparation system to provide interactive
``answer boxes'' for student input and auto-grader responses.
